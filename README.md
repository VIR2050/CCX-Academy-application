These were group projects which were formally presented at the end.

This project was about designing a System Client to facilitate secure remote access for customers and employees for a Telco.
It involved regulatory and basic technical security obligations which was platformed around AWS as the Cloud platform.

    - Authentication Mechanisms (Page 8)
    - Encryption and Key Management (Page 9, 10)


**Networking Infrastructure**
This project was about assessing a company's initial networking design which we had to identify a vulnerability for and exploit it.
The exploit was a curl command to access a file manager in an outdated Wordpress patch.
We then sought to improve the network by recommending a Firewall, System hardening, Monitoring and logging and access controls (RBAC)
